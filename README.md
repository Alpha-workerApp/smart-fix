# Smart-Fix Application

- Created separate folders for ai, backend and frontend.
- Create a new branch specific to the development process. For example, name the branch like this:
  - frontend-dev-suryaa
  - ai-dev-syed
- Push your code only to that branch. After review push it to the main branch. Inform before you push code.
- All of us trying to push to the main branch could lead to problems with version control.

--- 

- Later add the project documentation here... once completed.
