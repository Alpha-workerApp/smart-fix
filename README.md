# Smart-Fix Application

-   Created separate folders for ai, backend and frontend.
-   Create a new branch specific to the development process. For example, name the branch like this:
    -   frontend-dev-suryaa
    -   ai-dev-syed
-   Push your code only to that branch. After review push it to the main branch. Inform before you push code.
-   When all of us develop different sections simultaneously and when you try to push to main branch, if your local branch is not out of date, you can't push your development code to remote main branch.
-   But even if you try to update your local repository, your development code could be overwritten. So consider using a new branch other than main branch.

-   Later add the project documentation here... once completed.
